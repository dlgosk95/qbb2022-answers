Nice work! This is nearly perfect! Good job labelling your plots, as well. One very minor thing: in your manhattan plots, I think you may be also plotting the pvals for the covariates. If you look in the output of running the linear regression, there's a `TEST` column that should help you out with that. (no points deducted).

Awesome job Hannah, this is really great work.
