### Exercise 1

Nice work! For the last part ("Do the results make sense given what you know about the biology of these bases?"), the question is asking why you see this particular pattern. Check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics).

### Exercise 2

In progress...

### Exercise 3

Looks great! Good use of pseudocode in the first part.


Same comment as the lunch exercise about formatting markdown files...will be easier to read if you enclose code blocks with triple backticks: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks
