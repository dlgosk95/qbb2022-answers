# day 4 homework feedback

Very nice plots!

Good observations in your README overall, especially comparing the homework to the paper ! Just one small note:

* "Lower the number of tosses, less poweer it has. Closer the probabiility to 0.5, more power." -- closer to a prob of 0.5, also has less power, correct? Later in your README you make an observation that shows that you observed this, so just a small clarification.

The code looks fantastic as well! You may want to add your script, not just the code in the README, but what you have works very well and is acceptable

Estimated completion: 100%
